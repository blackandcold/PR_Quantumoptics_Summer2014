\begin{abstract}
\noindent Goal of the experiment was a violation of the CHSH-Bell-inequality by using the process of spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) to create entangled photons. Even though the experiment was not successfully completed, the experimental setup is shown as well as problems during execution. Also the calculations for violating the inequality are done with data from another group's experiment.\\

\section{Bell's Inequality}
This work is intended to show that entanglement cannot be described in a classical way. It was the work of J.S. Bell based on the paper of Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen (EPR). With the CHSH-Bell inequality it became possible to do a rather simple experiment with photons.\\
The purpose of Bell-type experiments is to find clues, wether nature behaves in a quantum mechanical sense, or QM is an incomplete theory, where hidden variables would lead to a complete theory restoring some properties, similar to our macroscopic experience, namely  reality and locality (as EPR proposed).\\
\\
\textbf{Reality:}\\ The properties of every object, even of atoms or sub-atomic particles, are real and measurable (in principle) at every time (no quantum-state superpositions).\\
\textbf{Locality:}\\
Information obtained by some measurement cannot influence the outcome of another measurement while having to travel faster than light.\\
\\
Bell-Experiments provide the fascinating possibility to test such rather philosophical ideas by performing actual measurements.

%In the next sections the theory will be explained as well as the experimental assembly and the results. Finally we will discuss the outcome.

\section{Theory}
\label{theory}

\subsection{Entanglement and the \\ Inequality}
The EPR paradox is based on entangled states, meaning quantum mechanical states of 2 (or more) subsystems, that cannot be written as tensor products of 2 states. In this experiment 2-qubit-states are used of which the basis are the 4 Bell-states:
$$|\Psi^{\pm}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle_A|1\rangle_B \pm |1\rangle_A|0\rangle_B)$$
$$|\Phi^{\pm}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle_A|0\rangle_B \pm |1\rangle_A|1\rangle_B)$$

\noindent Where A and B (typically called "Alice and Bob") denote the 2 subsystems.\\
Using the $|\Psi^{-}\rangle$-state (realized by spin-1/2 particles as imagined by Bell or by H/V-polarized photons as in this experiment) the subsystems are anti-correlated, meaning that a measurement by Alice resulting in H-polarization, leads to the Bob-particle being V, no matter how far apart. Not violating reality or locality, this can only be achieved by adding some hidden variable $\lambda$ to the picture.\\

\subsection{CHSH-Bell Inequallity}
John Clauser \textit{et al} developed a version of the Bell-equation, that can be performed in a real experimental setup (Bell's idea relies on a 'perfect' error-free setup).\\
The CHSH-setup tests reality and locality through statistical results, rather than exact measurements of single-runs of the experiment.\\
$E(\alpha, \beta)$ is the expectation value of a 2-qubit-state measured along parameters (e.g. angles) $\alpha$ and $\beta$.\\
Using different configurations for $\alpha$ and $\beta$, the Bell parameter is derived:
$$S(\alpha, \alpha', \beta, \beta') = E(\alpha, \beta) - $$
$$-E(\alpha, \beta') + E(\alpha', \beta) + E(\alpha', \beta')$$
\\
where:  $-2 \le S \le 2$

\subsection{Bell-Measurements}
$E(\alpha, \beta) = (-0.611 \pm 0.036)$\\
$E(\alpha, \beta ') = (0.765 \pm 0.041)$\\
$E(\alpha, \beta) = (-0.715\pm 0.038)$\\
$E(\alpha, \beta) = (-0.500 \pm 0.032)$\\

$$S(\alpha, \alpha ', \beta , \beta ') = (-2.591 \pm 0.074)$$

$$|S| > 2$$\\

\noindent For every single measurement, an \textbf{uncertainty of 5$\%$} was assumed.\\
The uncertainties of the results are calculated with Gaussian error propagation.

\section{Discussion}
Since we never came as far as to do actual measurements, the discussion will be divided into 2 parts:

\subsection{Execution of the Experiment}
The first 3 days were spent practicing alignment, learning how to use the equipment and some of the tricks, experimentalists use, so an analysis of possible error sources, improvements as well as things that worked well, is difficult.\\
From the speed, we picked up on the last day, where it was finally possible to do a reliable pre-alignment and couple the beams into the detector in a reasonable time, one can conclude, that the setup and equipment shouldn't prevent one from executing the experiment.\\
One possible error that showed up, though, was a mismatch of quality between the 2 detectors. Swapping the signals showed a difference of about a factor of 2. This could be easily accounted for at the stage of the experiment, where we had to end, though.\\
Especially in a training environment, one has to take into account unclean of faulty optical elements.\\
Without having finished the experiment and due to our general inexperience in the workings of optics experiments, it is not possible to exactly pinpoint any experimental or equipment errors.

\subsection{Bell-Violation}
From the data, that was provided, it is possible to violate the CHSH inequality.\\
For the visibility measurement, the mean was taken of all 4 combinations in each basis, while the uncertainty stems from standard deviation and student-t correction.\\
The H/V-visibility is clearly greater than $1/\sqrt{2}$ as is the X+/X- visibility after optimizing Bob's BBO.\\
The X+/X- measurements before though, clearly not suffice the requirement und thus where discarded.\\
\\
For the uncertainties of the expectation values $E(\alpha, \beta)$, an error of 5\% was assumed for every single measurement. This seems to be more than enough, since the measurement itself is already an average.\\
Gaussian error-propagation was assumed for the calculation, leading up to the result for S.\\
\\
Since the result clearly violates the inequality, one can conclude, that also a to small assumed error, wouldn't change the outcome (10\% uncertainties lead to a mere $(-2.59 \pm 0.15)$ result and thus still violating the inequality easily).
