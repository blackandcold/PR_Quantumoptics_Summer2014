\section{Bell's Inequality}
This work is intended to show that entanglement cannot be described in a classical way. It was the work of J.S. Bell based on the paper of Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen (EPR). With the CHSH-Bell inequality it became possible to do a (rather) simple experiment with photons. In the next sections the theory will be explained as well as the experimental assembly and the results. Finally we will discuss the outcome.
